# Setsuna
**With over 700 lines of code, Setsuna is almost ready for a full release!**

Setsuna is a general-purpose Discord Bot, and one of the few made in discord.py!
She currently features 10 commands (not including settings), a Starboard (with pineapples), and various settings
## Feature List:
- Lists audit log actions
- Lists banned members
- Starboard
- Server invite command
- Banning and kicking
- Deleted message logging
- Love and care
## Setup
- Download and extract the source code
- Open main.py in a Python 3.7+ interpreter
- Enter your bot account's token and YOUR Discord ID
- Type '.help settings' and Setsuna will explain the rest!
## Plans
After Setsuna's SQLite Branch is out of beta, this branch will resume development as Single-Server Setsuna, and she'll have exclusive functions that use too many API requests for public bots

Thank you so much to everyone who reads this. I've poured over 80 hours into this project, and it's finally nearing a "completed" state. I hope you'll join me for the rest of the ride. ;-;
